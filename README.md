# Project-2--Data-Acquisition-and-Data-Wrangling.
This GitHub repository contains Jupyter Notebook files and associated data for a data wrangling and data acquisition project using the Pandas and Numpy libraries in Python. In this project, we demonstrate various techniques for acquiring, cleaning, and manipulating data using these powerful data analysis tools.

# Project Overview
Data wrangling and data acquisition are critical steps in the data analysis and machine learning process. This project aims to provide practical examples and best practices for working with data using Pandas and Numpy. You can use these materials to learn and practice data manipulation techniques in Python.

In the Jupyter Notebook included in this repository, you will find examples of how to:

1. Load data from various sources, such as CSV files, Excel spreadsheets, and databases.
2. Clean and preprocess data, handling missing values and outliers.
3. Perform data transformations, such as filtering, merging, and concatenating.
4. Explore data to gain insights.
5. Checking Cental Tendency, skewness and correlation.
7. By following this notebook, you will gain a better understanding of how to effectively work with data using Pandas and Numpy, making you well-equipped to tackle data-related challenges in your projects.

# Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
       git clone https://github.com/Bhuvinarang/Project-2--Data-Acquisition-and-Data-Wrangling.git
   
3. Install the required dependencies. You can use pip to install them:
       pip install pandas numpy jupyter matplotlib
   
5. Navigate to the project directory:
       cd Project-2--Data-Acquisition-and-Data-Wrangling
   
7. Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the file to start learning and practicing data wrangling techniques.
       
# Prerequisites
To fully benefit from this project, you should have a basic understanding of Python and data analysis concepts. Familiarity with Pandas and Numpy is a plus but not mandatory. You can learn as you go through the notebooks.
